      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\n",
      "\n",
      "together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\n",
      "\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "\n",

      "in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim\n",
      "\n",
      "might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\n",

      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\n",
      "\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\n",
      "\n",
      "awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\n",
      "\n",
      " So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\n",
      "\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "\n",
      "part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "\n",
      "hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\n",
      "\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We\n",
      "\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\n",
      "\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\n",
      "\n",
      "in blood.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\n",

      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\n",
      "\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\n",

      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\n",
      "\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\n",
      "\n",
      "killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\n",
      "\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\n",

      "\n",

      "it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\n",
      "\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\n",

      "it.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\n",
      "\n",
      "the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\n",
      "\n",
      "it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\n",

      "in these parts for a year or more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\n",
      "\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of\n",
      "\n",
      "anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready\n",
      "\n",
      "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\n",
      "\n",
      "Watson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:\n",
